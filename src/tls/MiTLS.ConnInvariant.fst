   The main application level invariant is:
     Every writer in the ms_tab has an empty log
     unless it has been registered within some epoch of a connection

   To maintain this invariant, we strengthen it with some technical
   nuances, mainly related to framing.

(* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1. Deriving a new writer, using MS.derive
     2. Registering a writer with a connection
     3. Mutating the log of some writer
     4. Adding a new connection

(*
   Case 1:
     Deriving a new key involves adding a new writer to the ms table (because we tried a lookup at id and it failed)
     It's ok, because a new log is empty and adding an empty writer is fine regardless of the connections

(* Case 4:
    Adding a connection (writing to conn table) we note that none of the bad writers can be attributed to this connection
     -- So, we cannot be in the Some w, None case, as this is only for bad writers
     -- We cannot also be in the first case, since the conn table is monotonic and it doesn't already contain the id
    Note: we can prove that the having a doomed writer is a monotonic property of nonces
